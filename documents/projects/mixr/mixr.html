        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          I have recently completed a semester of object oriented programming in C++.
          I was determined to take what I learned and create something applicable
          that I could use in my everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was <em>dissatisfied</em> with the music players that Windows had to offer,
          and found that ITunes always ran so slow.
          So, I decided to create my own simple music player using C++ along with
          Qt for the graphical user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't aim to create anything groundbreaking or innovative. Just something that would
          support automatic playback, shuffle, and other basic functionality
          such as play the next/previous song, pause/play and mute/unmute audio.

        <h2>Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
          Simply, there are three classes: a <em>song</em> class, a <em>playlist</em>
          class, which held a collection of <em>song</em> objects, and a <em>player</em> class,
          which facilitated the interaction between a playlist object and the GUI. The song class
          only had two fields: the file path of the song along with the name of the song, which
          is the filename of the song. In the future, I hope to find a way to extract metadata
          from each song to get other attributes, such as the artist and album. But for now, this will
          suffice.

          <h2>Final Result</h2>
          <p>
          Styling the Qt GUI was identical to styling using CSS. I decided to
          create a dark theme. The final result of this project after importing <i>LUV Is Rage 2</i>
          looked something like this:
          </p>
          <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" src="mixr.png" alt="mixr">
          </p>
          <hr>
        </div>
        <div id="last-words">
          <h2>Last Words</h2>
          <p> The code for this project can be viewed on my GitHub repository
            <a href="https://github.com/south-west/mixr" target="_blank">here</a>.
          I will most likely come visit this project in the future.
          This is a very simple music player, and lacks a lot of the functionality of a modern music player.
          Nevertheless, I had a lot of fun creating something built in C++ that I could use on a
          daily basis. </p>
