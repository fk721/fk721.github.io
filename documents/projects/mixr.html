        <h2>Goal</h2>
        I have recently completed a semester of object oriented programming in C++.
        I was determined to take what I learned and create something applicable
        that I could use in my everyday life.
        <br />
        I was <i>dissatisfied</i> with the music players that Windows had to offer,
        and found that ITunes always ran so slow.
        So, I decided to create my own simple music player using C++ and
        Qt for the graphical user interface.
        <br />
        I didn't aim to create anything groundbreaking or innovative. Just something that would
        play my music that I'd import from a library, shuffle files, and other basic music player things
        such as play the next/previous song, pause/play and mute/unmute audio.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class = "section">
        <h2>Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
          Simply, there are three classes: a <i>song</i> class, a <i>playlist</i>
          class, which held a collection of <i>song</i> objects, and a <i>player</i> class,
          which facilitated the interaction between a playlist object and the GUI. The song class
          only had two fields: the file path of the song along with the name of the song, which
          is the filename of the song. In the future, I hope to find a way to extract metadata
          from each song to get other attributes, such as the artist and album. But for now, this will
          suffice for my purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Result</h2>
        <p>
        Styling the Qt GUI was identical to styling using CSS. I decided to
        create a dark theme. The final result of this project after importing <i>LUV Is Rage 2</i>
         looked something like this:
        </p>
        <img src="mixr.png" alt="mixr">
        <br />
        </div>
      <div class = clr> </div>
      <div class = "section">
        <h2> Last Words </h2>
        <p>
           The code for this project can be viewed on my GitHub repository
           <a href = "https://github.com/south-west/mixr" title = "mixr GitHub"
           target = "_blank"> <b><i>here</i></b></a>.
           <br />
           I will most likely come visit this project in the future. This is
           a very simple music player, and lacks a lot of the functionality of a
           modern music player. Nevertheless, this was a fun project that utilized
           several object oriented design principles that I learned and achieved several goals
           that I had.
